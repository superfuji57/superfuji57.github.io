The NBA.com/stats site is arguably the best sports statistics interface across all sports and sports leagues. Thanks to a couple of great posts by Greg Reda and Daniel Forsyth ([here](gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/) and [here](danielforsyth.me/exploring_nba_data_in_python/)), I decided to see how I can use R to 


```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
source("~/Projects/NBA-shots/shinyApp/shotLog.R")
5 + 5
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
dat <- getShotLog("Stephen Curry", season = "2014-15")
heat.dat <- heat_data(dat)
result_map(heat.dat)
```
