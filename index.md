# Hi, I'm Andy Won.

### Data science, dancing, and everything else

Andy Won is a data analyst living in Brooklyn who is not at all comfortable with writing in third person.

This is a site I'm building with Github and Jekyll. I will be posting notes I've taken (with code) from lectures and tutorials, my own projects, dance clips after I fix my back, and anything else that comes along.
