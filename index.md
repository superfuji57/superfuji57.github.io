# Hi.

Andy Won is a data analyst based in Brooklyn, NY who is not at all comfortable with writing in third person.

<br>
This is a site I'm building with Github pages and Jekyll. I will be posting notes I've taken (with code) from lectures and tutorials, my own projects, and anything else that comes along, as well as playing with the site's design.
