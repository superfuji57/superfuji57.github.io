# Hi, I'm Andy Won.

### Data science, dancing, and everything else

Andy Won is a data analyst living in Brooklyn who is not at all comfortable with writing in third person.

This is a site I'm building with Github and Jekyll. I will be posting notes I've taken (with code) from lectures and tutorials, my own projects, and anything else that comes along, as well as playing with the site's overall design.
