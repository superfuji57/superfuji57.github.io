### NBA Shots Stats
 
Seeing what I can do using the NBA.com/stats player shot logs API.

* [A table of NBA player IDs](https://github.com/superfuji57/nba-playerIDs) and info to use with the NBA.com/stats API that I scraped.

* [Data Viz!]() with a guest appearance by the Splash Brothers.

* [The code for the app so far.](https://github.com/superfuji57/NBA-shots) - fork on Github and let's collaborate!

### [Text Prediciton](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)
[This is an app I made for the Data Science Specialization capstone.](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)


* Take a corpus of large text files (blogs, tweets, and news articles) and turn them into data
* Explore and use said data to build a next-word prediction algorithm similar to the one used by SwiftKey (auto-correct)
* Build the algorithm into a Shiny (R package) app

[Here is my course records page.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/44zGfInkEe) This was a lot of fun and my first foray into natural language processing. I plan to build out details around the app to be something a bit more presentable.

### Web Development

Building a site with Jekyll and Github pages.

* This site!
