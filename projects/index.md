### [Text Prediciton](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)
[This is an app I made for the Data Science Specialization capstone.](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)

Basic summary:

* Take a corpus of large text files (blogs, tweets, and news articles) and turn them into data
* Explore and use said data to build a next-word prediction algorithm similar to the one used by SwiftKey (auto-correct)
* Build the algorithm into a Shiny (R package) app

[Here is my course records page.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/44zGfInkEe) This was a lot of fun and my first foray into natural language processing. I plan to build out details around the app to be something a bit more presentable.
