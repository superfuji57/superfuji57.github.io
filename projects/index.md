#### Exploring NBA Data with R
 
Seeing what I can do using the NBA.com/stats player shot logs API. So far:

* [A table of NBA player IDs](https://github.com/superfuji57/nba-playerIDs) and other information to use with the NBA.com/stats API that I scraped.

* __Data Viz!__ with a guest appearance by the Splash Brothers: [Steph](/images/steph-curry-shots.jpg) and [Klay](/images/klay-thompson-shots.jpg).

* [The code for the app so far.](https://github.com/superfuji57/NBA-shots) - fork on Github and let's collaborate!

#### [Text Prediction](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)
[This is an app I made for the Data Science Specialization capstone.](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor/)

Summary of the project: 

* Take a corpus of large text files (blogs, tweets, and news articles) and turn them into data
* Explore and use said data to build a next-word prediction algorithm similar to the one used by SwiftKey (auto-correct)
* Build the algorithm into a Shiny (R package) app

[Here is my course records page.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/44zGfInkEe) This was a lot of fun and my first foray into natural language processing. I plan to build out details around the app to be something a bit more presentable.

#### Web Development

Building a site with Jekyll and Github pages.

* This site!

* I mostly followed this tutorial: [link](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/)

* [Link to the theme's repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)

#### Other

* [Exploring the NOAA Storm Database](http://rpubs.com/superfuji57/stormproject) - an exploratory data analysis.

* [My first R Shiny app using a basketball-reference.com scraper and rCharts](https://andywon.shinyapps.io/Nets-Shiny/)
