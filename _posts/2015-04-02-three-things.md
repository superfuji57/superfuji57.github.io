### [R Meetup on the assertr Package](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/221109492/)

Meetups were essential in my journey to becoming a data person, and this particular group organized by [Jared Lander](https://twitter.com/jaredlander) is my favorite. Talking to other professionals/enthusiasts/pros/beginners really helps fire synapses in the brain that stay dormant when holed up in a corner studying by one's self. I don't go to them as much as I did when I first started, but I'm usually happy when I do go; this was no exception.

[Tony Fischetti](https://github.com/tonyfischetti) presented his new [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr) package, which introduces defensive programming to `R`. It has some great functions that can be used with the piping (`%>%`) grammar made popular in dplyr and magrittr in the form of verbs `assert()` and `verify()`. I plan on implementing this into my workflow immediately. And, like any good presenter he's posted his slides, which can be found [here](http://www.onthelambda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/assertr-presentation.html#/).

### [Frankie Knuckles Boiler Room Set](http://boilerroom.tv/recording/frankie-knuckles-60-min-mix/)

The Godfather of house Frankie Knuckles passed away last year on March 31st. I won't pretend to know much about the history or house genre itself, but I know funky. This set has soul and is MAD FONKY, and is permanently placed in the forever ever jam list.

### Caffeine and L-Theanine

My first foray into [nootropics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic). Seeing how I already take advantage of every reasonable opportunity to have a coffee, I figured give it a shot. I've already taken L-theanine as part of a BCAA supplement, so I'm pretty sure I won't die. 

In short, the combination is supposed to give you a more chill mood, which sounds great to an introvert (see: [When Introverts Should Avoid Coffee](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/10/when-introverts-should-avoid-coffee.html)). There's [_some evidence_](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/5841233_The_effects_of_L-theanine_caffeine_and_their_combination_on_cognition_and_mood) -- and so far so good, in my experience -- but I won't pretend like I'm living proof.
