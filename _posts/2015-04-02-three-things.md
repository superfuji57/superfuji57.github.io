### [R Meetup on the assertr Package](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/221109492/)

Meetups were essential in my journey to becoming a data person, and this particular group organized by [Jared Lander](https://twitter.com/jaredlander) is my favorite. Talking to other professionals/enthusiasts/pros/beginners really helps fire synapses in the brain that stay dormant when holed up in a corner studying by one's self. I don't go to them as much as I did when I first started, but I'm usually happy when I do go; this was no exception.

[Tony Fischetti](https://github.com/tonyfischetti) presented his new [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr) package, which introduces defensive programming to `R`. It has some great functions that can be used with the piping (`%>%`) grammar made popular in dplyr and magrittr in the form of verbs `assert()` and `verify()`. I plan on implementing this into my workflow immediately. And, like any good presenter he's posted his slides, which can be found [here](http://www.onthelambda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/assertr-presentation.html#/).

### [Frankie Knuckles Boiler Room Set](http://boilerroom.tv/recording/frankie-knuckles-60-min-mix/)

The Godfather of house Frankie Knuckles passed away last year on March 31st. I won't pretend to know much about the history or house genre itself, but I know funky. This set has soul and is MAD FONKY, and is permanently placed in the forever ever jam list.
