# * Top Five
I've always been a fan of Chris Rock from his standup in the past. More recently, it's been an obsession after listening to him on an episode of [the Champs](URL FOR THE EP), his interview in [NYMAG](LINK) and his editorial in [the Hollywood Reporter](LINK). When he opens up, I find myself nodding accordingly if I'm not laughing hysterically. If he wrote the nutritional contents of the food he buys his children, I'd preach that shit at church. At 50 years old, Chris Rock might be just *entering* his prime.
