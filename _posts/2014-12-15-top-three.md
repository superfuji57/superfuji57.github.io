### #MillionsMarchNYC
For me, this march wasn't about knee jerk reactions, or what we may or may not have seen on video. It was about support and community. I'm not an activist; I came in as a pretty quiet guy usually avoiding the conversation trying to keep my boring life together. But I marched, and I witnessed Americans of every color/age/shape/height/etc/seriouslyeverything expressing their frustrations and responding to one another with their presence as support.

### Top Five
I've always been a fan of Chris Rock from his standup in the past. Lately, it's been an obsession with his appearance on **[Juan Epstein](https://soundcloud.com/rosenbergradio/chris-rock-and-uestlove-on-a-majour-thanksgiving-juan-ep)**, his interview in **[New York Mag](http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html)** and his editorial in **[the Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-rock-talks-choke-holds-756864)**. Basically, movie-promoting Chris Rock is the best.

### Data Science Specialization
After nine mini courses and a capstone, I will have completed the data science specialization offered by **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)** and taught by Brian Caffo, Jeff Leek, and Roger Peng of the Johns Hopkins biostats department (final project grade pending, which you can check out [here](andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor)!. I plan to go more in-depth into my overall experience, but in short, I owe Coursera for the skills and confidence I have in an area that seemed unattainable 16 months ago. I can't recommend it any higher, especially for those considering a career change. It's free and there's something for everyone.
