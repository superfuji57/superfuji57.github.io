### [Yield in 3D by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/19/upshot/3d-yield-curve-economic-growth.html?rref=upshot)

Important because it's the first time I've thought a 3D plot was useful. Leave it up to Amanda Cox and team NYT to push the field.

### [To Pimp a Butterfly](http://open.spotify.com/album/7ycBtnsMtyVbbwTfJwRjSP)

So far, I'm a fan of these surprise releases. Only a week early, waking up to the new Kendrick on Monday morning softened the blow of the new work week. Somehow, it feels different than a "leak." Maybe actually releasing on release day will be the new surprise.

What I remember about when music was primarily in physical form was waiting for release day to get the Makaveli CD, the Tupac album that came out weeks after his death. I wasn't even in high school then, but I loved Pac's music without ever really understanding it.

To Pimp a Butterfly really bridges the gap for me from [Me Against the World](http://open.spotify.com/album/3OrucS4sHv6Bl9GS4rafEk). To a 12-year old Asian kid in Las Vegas, the names Amadou Diallo and Sean Bell were lyrics; but Eric Garner and Michael Brown happened. There's tragedy in this type of connection in music decades apart, but hope in [K-Dot's awareness and intent on using his influence](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-on-his-new-album-and-the-weight-of-clarity.html).

### [Pocket Vs. Tata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR5bhLwmiH0#t=164)

That first round!
