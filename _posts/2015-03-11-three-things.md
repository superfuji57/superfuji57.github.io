### [Rembert Brown on Obama and the "chase"](http://grantland.com/features/barack-obama-selma-50th-anniversary/)

This is a great piece internet right here. Go read.

### [Kehinde Wiley: A New Republic](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/kehinde_wiley_new_republic/)

Currently at the Brooklyn Museum (free on the first Saturday of the month, which is when I went). Great paintings and sculptures. Worth it for the huge Michael Jackson mural alone.

### [Dataclysm by Christian Rudder](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385347372)

Great book by the co-founder of the dating site OkCupid on what we say and do online says about us. Easy to read and interpret charts and analyses.
