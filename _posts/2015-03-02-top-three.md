### Fortress of Solitude
Trying to keep pace with my one book a month (and alternating between fiction and non-fiction) goal, I finished reading [_Fortress of Solitude_](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375724886) and am close to done with [_Dataclysm_](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385347372). Both great reads!

### NBA Player Data
I've started working on an R Shiny app exploring the NBA.com/stats player shot log API. The API requires unique playerIDs, which I couldn't find anywhere, so I wrote a scraper to build a table. I outlined that [here](http://www.andywon.nyc/nba-player-IDs).

### Basketball
Nets vs. Warriors: A high-scoring affair, with clutch Steph Curry 3s, a game-winning Jarret Jack jumper with 1.1 seconds left, and a Nets win. I love this game!
