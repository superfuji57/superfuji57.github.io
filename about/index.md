#### _Always a student, never a master_.

I'm a funky Earth-based human with 31 years of experience -- 5+ in New York City, 24 in Las Vegas, and ~2 in Texas and Michigan. 

### Data Science

I knew I wanted to make an impact on the world through data when I first learned about linear regression taking undergraduate economics. The intersection of statistics and social science made perfect sense for a person like me: _kinda_ good at math and naturally curious about how and why we behave the way we do.

Books about behavioral economics like Freakonomics, Nudge, the Gladwell stuff, and eventually my favorite, Thinking Fast and Slow, confirmed that this what I'd do with my life. I saw this [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/2012/04/ff_abtesting/) and saw the tech world as a vibrant place for research.

Then there was *that other article that will never be linked here* touting a data scientist would be the "sexiest job" for the next 100 years. That piece, and all its children, made one thing clear: data science is poorly defined. At different, rotating points I believed everything from "I can obviously do this" to "there's no way I can do this without at least a Ph.D." 

Until [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments). My first courses were Andrew Ng's on [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) and Bill Howe's [Intro to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci). Taking these two classes gave me the high level overview of important data science concepts and some basic coding skills. More importantly, they made data science feel accessible. There are countless classes offered on Coursera and other MOOC platforms for everything from public speaking to Kierkegaard. I can't recommend them enough.

I also can't overstate how powerfully they've impacted me. FREE learning opportunities from world-leading academics. Sadly, the majority of the students taking these courses are employed and already have college degrees ([article](http://chronicle.com/article/In-Deals-With-10-Public/139533/?cid=at&utm_source=at&utm_medium=en)). Disrupting the university has its merits, but I want to see these resources utilized on those who've historically had the widest gap to access. It's an engagement issue I'm betting data science can help solve.

### B-Boying

The dance that I've been performing or spectating for 17 years. My framework for learning (including data science) and lense for the creative process. More to come...
