I'm a New York City-based human with 31 years of experience. 

<br>
I graduated with a BS in Economics from UNLV, but have continued my education in a zillion different things since. Most recently, I completed the data science specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics department through Coursera. [Here is my course records page.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/44zGfInkEe)

<br>
I'm still working on setting up this site, including this page.
