#### _Always a student, never a master_.

I am a native Las Vegan currently living and working in New York City as a data analyst with [Scholastic](http://www.scholastic.com) on the BI and Analytics team.

I love basketball, b-boying, and behavioral science. My goal is to laugh and dance as much as this life can take. 

My initial intent for this site was to post my notes, tutorials, and experiences on working with data as a way to contribute to the open source data science community that has given me so much. In the process, I figured I'd sharpen up my writing (bare with me) and keep track of all life-journey-related things. So, basically Xanga 2.0 (Edit: WAIT XANGA 2.0 IS AN ACTUAL THING!?!). 

I used Jekyll and Github Pages (and [this tutorial](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) with the [Minimal Mistake theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). 

#### Sources of learning and inspiration
I owe a ton to the following:

* [__Coursera__](http://www.coursera.org) and [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/andrewyng). Prior to May 2013, my data science skillset consisted of basic statistics knowledge and a hobby for behavioral economics (read: I had none). This journey started with free classes on Coursera.

* [__Hadley Wickham__](http://had.co.nz/) known for the Hadley-verse, an immensely helpful collection of data tools in the form of packages for the R language. Also, reinforces the mantra of *embracing frustration*. 

* __Daniel Kahneman__, the godfather of behavioral economics. Read [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780606275644)

* [The Johns Hopkins Biostats team](http://simplystatistics.org/) who teach the __Data Science Specialization on Coursera__

* The entire open source data science community, whose work I keep up with everyday on [DataTau](http://www.datatau.com/) and with my [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/andy_juan/lists/tech-data).

* [Knucklehead Zoo](http://www.knuckleheadzoo.com/), my dance crew with whom I go back 16 years.

* [Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/user/floorstatik/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=p) - dope member of the b-boy community, but overall multi-talented artist. He proved to me that you can apply your creative energy into other mediums successfully.

* [Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCo6ZgK0Ogg) - living funk style god

* More to come
