### [Rembert Brown on Obama and the "chase"](http://grantland.com/features/barack-obama-selma-50th-anniversary/)

### Kehinde Wiley: A New Republic

Currently at the Brooklyn Museum (free on the first Saturday of the month, which is when I went).

### Soul Night

A key element to healthy life is dancing. There's three, the other two are laughing and learning.
