##Next Word Text Prediction App(andywon.shinyapps.io/text-predictor)

This is an app I put together as the final project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization. The assignment required students to take a set of three text files collected from blogs, news sites, and tweets as a corpora to build a "next word" prediction app similar to those integrated into smartphone keyboards. The project was capstone produced by professors from the Johns Hokpins University department of biostatistics in association with SwiftKey, the company that built the app currently used in the iPhone and Android phones.

The app utilizes the awesome Shiny library for the R language.

##NBA Analytics Visualizer

This is app also began in Coursera as project for the Data Products course.

##andywon.nyc

When the .nyc landrush happened back in August I reserved this domain to force myself to finally put together a personal site. In the time I put off actually putting this thing together, I became more comfortable with Github and played around with Github pages. That led to discovering Jekyll, which I consider a gift. Jekyll allowed me to forgo paying for hosting services as well as keeping the back-end stack simple (no need for Apache, MySql, PHP, or WordPress).
